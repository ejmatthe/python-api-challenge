## WeatherPy

## VacationPy
In VacationPy, I added the Geoviews library in the initial importing. From there, I imported the city data from WeatherPy's output path, and then used Geoviews to create points from the data. In doing so, I defined the dimensions based on the specific titling of the Latitude and Longitude columns, and set the Humidity to adjust the points' size.
